# Developer Guide

## Getting started

Here is a simple example on how to try out the add-on component:

```java

// Initialize our new UI component
final Magnifier magnifier = new Magnifier();
// set the magnifier image 
magnifier.setImageUrl("http://rfp.laudert.de/previews/assets/prev_m/9/3/3/3/1869333.jpg");
// set the Height of the magnifier image
magnifier.setHeight(600, Unit.PIXELS);
// set the Width of the magnifier image 
magnifier.setWidth(400, Unit.PIXELS);          
// OPTIONAL: Set the ZoomImageUrl. This should be a higher quality image. Used for a good and clean magnifying effect
magnifier.setZoomImageUrl("http://rfp.laudert.de/previews/assets/prev_l/9/3/3/3/1869333.jpg");
// Sets the zoom factor of the magnifier. A zoom factor of 1 means the image in the magnifier has native width 
// and if the image shown in the panel is smaller than the native image due to resizing the window, 1 is producing a zoom effect.
magnifier.setZoomFactor(1.5f);


```
